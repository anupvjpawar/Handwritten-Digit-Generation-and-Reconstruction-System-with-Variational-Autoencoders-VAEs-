# Handwritten Digit Generation and Reconstruction System with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

This project demonstrates the use of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate and reconstruct handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The application allows users to explore the latent space of the VAE and visualize how variations in the latent space affect the generated digit images. The user interface is built with Streamlit, making it easy to interact with the model and see the results in real-time.

## Project Overview

**Title:** Handwritten Digit Generation and Reconstruction System

**Objective:** Create a system using VAEs to generate and reconstruct handwritten digits. The project includes:
- **Data Preparation:** Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
- **VAE Architecture:** Building and training a Variational Autoencoder to encode and decode digit images.
- **Web Interface:** Using Streamlit to provide an interactive platform for users to explore and visualize the generated digits.

## Features

- **Image Reconstruction:** Reconstruct images from the MNIST dataset using the trained VAE.
- **Digit Generation:** Generate new digit images by sampling from the latent space.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Use Streamlit to interact with the model and view results.
